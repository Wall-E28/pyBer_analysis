# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis

The CEO of Pyber has tasked me with analyzing the company's ride-share data using python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. He wants me to provide insight on the differences between the three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The main areas that I look into through this project are, a general overview, rides, drivers, and fares in all three city types.

## Results


There are 4 different areas of analysis needed to complete this project. These are:

1. Overview of City Types
2. Rides per City Type
3. Drivers per City Type
4. Fares per City Type

### Overview of City Types

The overview of the city types consists of a bubble chart highlighting the comparison of rides, drivers, and fares. Drivers are represented by the size of the bubbles, fares by the y axis, and rides by the x axis.

### Rides per City Type

Rides per city type is broken up into two different categories: rides per city by city type and total rides per city type.

### Drivers per City Type

Drivers per city type is broken up into two different categories: drivers per city by city type and total drivers per city type.

### Fares per City Type

Fares per city tpes is broken up into three different categories: average fares per city by city type, total fares per city type, and weekly totals per city type.
